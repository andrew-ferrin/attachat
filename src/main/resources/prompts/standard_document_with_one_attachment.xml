            <SUBJECT>Trump's sudden shifts make his policies baffling to countries trying to negotiate lower tariffs</SUBJECT>

                In his letter to current Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Trump also incorrectly claimed that
                Brazilian trade barriers had caused "unsustainable Trade Deficits against the United States." In fact, U.S.
                exports to Brazil have exceeded imports for 18 straight years, including a $29 billion surplus last year.
                For some, Trump's action against Brazil indicates he's trying to exert influence over more than trade.
                "Trump seems to view tariffs as an instrument to influence not just other countries' trade and economic
                policies but even their domestic legal and political matters,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy
                at Cornell University. Trump's faith in the economic superpowers of tariffs is unshaken even though they so
                far have proven largely ineffective in bullying other countries to cut deals. On April 2, Trump announced
                the 10% baseline tariffs and larger "reciprocal" tariffs - up to 50% -- on dozens of countries with which
                the United States runs trade deficits. But responding to a rout in global financial markets, he quickly
                suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate.
